            <h1>Introducing Kandase Khepra - Chicago's Best Natural Hairstylist</h1>

            <div>
              <p>
                Oh, the dreaded struggle to find the right loctician/hair stylist who is familiar with the Black natural hair texture. For many of us, a trip to the hair salon is more than a task on our to-do list — it's a sanctuary, a mecca, and a place to go when we just want to feel brand new. Kandase (appropriately pronounced ‘can do’) Khepra has created a hair salon that targets Black women and men with sister locs, traditional locs, two strand twists, and various types of braid hairstyles. <br/><br/>
      There may be many Black beauty salons in Chicago, but what makes Kandase stand out from the pack is her commitment to provide the most professional and courteous service for the Black community. She recognizes that every Black person with natural hair has unique hair needs and her goal is to make you feel and look your best!

            <h3>Sister Locs and Traditional Locs</h3>
            <p>Getting locs is not just a change of hairstyle but also a change of lifestyle. During a traditional maintenance session, it will take a loctician 45 mins to 1 hour and a half to palm roll a full set of traditional locs. Sisterlocs are microlocs that are interlocked using a special tool. When sisterlocs are installed, depending on your hair length, your hair may be interlocked down the length of your hair, but definitely at the root. This allows you to have the locs without having to go through the different phases of locking your hair. Therefore, they are perfect for people who would find it challenging to grow traditional locks and prefer quick results.</p>
